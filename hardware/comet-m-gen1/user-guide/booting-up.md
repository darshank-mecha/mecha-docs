title: Booting Up - Comet-M

# Booting Up

Getting started with the Comet-M is as familiar as starting your Smartphone for the first time.

## Keep it plugged in

It is a good idea to plug the device to a USB-C charger to ensure that the first boot is uninterrupted. You can use the Type-C cable bundled in the box and either of the following charging solution - 

1. Use a Type-C charger that can deliver 2.4A at 5V DC. Most phone or laptop USB Type-C chargers in your household will support this.
2. You can even plug it to USB Type-C port that is PD (Power Delivery) compliant, like the ones on the Macbook.

If you see the white LED above the screen turn on, it means your device is now charging.

> ðŸ’¡ When your device is fully charged the white LED will turn itself off.

## Powering On

1. Press the Power Button on the right, hold it for a second to turn the device on. 
2. You will immediately see a green LED above the screen turn on, and the screen come up. Your device is now booting up.

## Working with the Launcher

### Status Bar

### App Drawer

### Action bar

### Settings Panel

## Locking the screen

Press the Power Button on the right while the device is turned on will lock your screen. You can unlock using the unlock button on the display.

## Powering down

Open up the Settings Panel by swiping down from the status bar, and use the Power-off options on the bottom to power down your device.

> ðŸ’¡ In case the UI is hung or unresponsive, holding the physical power button on the device for close to 4 seconds will turn your device off immediately, without triggering a grace-ful shutdown. This option should only be used sparingly.
